# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 23, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and Variables.

**Today's Progress**: Created a very simple Python app that creates a band name using the city you grew up in and your pet's name.

**Thoughts:** After coding in Ruby and JavaScript for the past year, it really nice to give Python a try. These topics were very basic and not that difficult but I feel it was good enough for this first day.

### Day 2: March 24, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Data Types, Numbers, Operation, Type Conversion, and f-Stings.

**Today's Progress**: Learned the data types in Python. Yesterday, I learned about Strings but today I learned integers, floats, and boolean. I focused on the data types of integers and floats and calculating using order of operations (EPMDAS). I also learned f-strings, which is a way to concatenate variables with values into a string. It reminded me a bit like template literals in JavaScript. Using all that I learned, I created another simple CLI python app which is a tip calculator. It asks for the total of the bill, percentage of tip you would like to give, and number of people in the party. The app calculates how much each person owes for the total bill plus tip.

**Thoughts:** I am math geek so today was a lot of fun learning how to perform mathematical functions in Python. Inputs take in numbers as strings, so it was a bit confusing making sure I knew the data type. And then how integers do not round. So that to me was the most challenging part of the day.

### Day 3: March 25, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Conditionals, Logic Operators, Code Blocks and Scope.

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on with Python basics, today I learned control flow with if/else and conditional operators, nested if and elif statements, multiple if statements in succession, and logic operators. To demonstrate my learning today, I created a simple CLI app that to get through to the treasure, you have to answer each question correct to advance to the next.

**Thoughts:** At least at this point in learning Python, I must say the syntax does seem easy to me. I imagine things will get a bit more complex as I progress. I feel the best way is baby steps with the fundamentals to ensure a solid foundation.

### Day 4: March 26, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Randomisation and Python Lists.

**Today's Progress**: I learned about Python's Random module, which is used to generate random numbers (either floats or integers). Lists are a data structure in Python. And you can nested lists. As the project for today, I made a CLI app to play Rock, Paper, Scissors.

**Thoughts:** I had no idea how robust the Python Random module was. But since it used for Data Science, it must need to handle some extreme mathematical calculations.

### Day 5: March 27 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Loops, Range, and Code Blocks.

**Today's Progress**: For today's project, I made a password generator CLI app in Python.

**Thoughts:** .
