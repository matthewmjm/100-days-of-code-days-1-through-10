# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 23, 2021

**Today's Topics**: PYTHON - printing, commenting, debugging, string manipulation and variables.

**Today's Progress**: Created a very simple Python app that creates a band name using the city you grew up in and your pet's name.

**Thoughts:** After coding in Ruby and JavaScript for the past year, it really nice to give Python a try. These topics were very basic and not that difficult but I feel it was good enough for this first day.
